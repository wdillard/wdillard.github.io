        <!--This 1956 GMC entered my life in late 2016. I got it for a project and had a vision of what I wanted to do. 
        I knew I wanted it to be reliable and easy to handle. I began to tear into everything to see how much I would 
        need to go into it to get it where I wanted.

        I choose to have the independent front suspension from a gen 3 camaro graphed in to the front of the truck. 
        This would give is superior performance and handling over the old leaf spring as well as a lower stance.
